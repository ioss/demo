# Fractal Demo

** !! This demo is currently a work in progress and is using the Fractal 1.0 beta !! **

This is a demo of an example [Fractal](http://github.com/frctl/fractal) project.

This demo site is _not_ intended to be the simplest possible example of how you can use Fractal. Instead the focus is on demonstrating some of the more advanced features that Fractal offers.
