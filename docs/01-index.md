title: Fractal Demo
---

This is a demo of the [Fractal](http://github.com/frctl/fractal) web interface. The full source code for this demo repository is [available on Github](https://github.com/frctl/demo). Have a poke around!

## About this demo

This demo site is _not_ intended to be the simplest possible example of how you can use Fractal. Instead the focus is on demonstrating some of the slightly more advanced features that Fractal offers.

Again, it's worth checking out the [source code on Github](https://github.com/frctl/demo) (especially the `fractal.js` file and the components) to get a better understanding for how it has been put together.

### Naming and organisation

Fractal lets you organise and name your components however you like. The way it's been done in this demo is just an example - you should use whatever format best suits your own project's needs.

### Components

The example components use Handlebars for their template engine. This is the default template engine that comes with Fractal.

The components use a mix of different [configuration file formats](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/blob/master/docs/configuration-files.md) in order to demonstrate the available possile options.

### Documentation

The documentation pages (including this one!) have been configured to use Nunjucks as a template engine, as opposed the default of Handlebars. Documentation pages are also passed through a Markdown parser after compilation.

### Web UI Theme

This demo uses the default Fractal theme &mdash; [Mandelbrot](https://github.com/frctl/demo) &mdash; with some simple customisation options applied.
