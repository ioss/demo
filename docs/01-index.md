title: Fractal Handlebars Demo
---

This is a demo of the default [Fractal](http://github.com/frctl/fractal) web interface. The full source code for this demo repository is [available on Github](https://github.com/frctl/handlebars-demo). Have a poke around!

## About this demo

This demo uses the default Fractal theme, 'Mandelbrot', with one of the alternative colour schemes applied.

Fractal lets you organise and name your components as you see fit - the way it's been done in this demo is just an example. You should use whatever format best suits your own project's needs.

### Components

The example components use Handlebars for their template engine. This is the default template engine that comes with Fractal.

They use a mix of different [configuration file formats](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/blob/master/docs/configuration-files.md) in order to give a range of examples of what is possible.
